<h1>My State of Mind</h1>

As another evening begins in 2025, a strange feeling washes over me. Lying in bed with my Macbook, I ponder the vastness of life ahead—it’s incredible.  I’ve witnessed people boast about their code and statistics, but 2024 taught me the pointlessness of such bragging.  I also discovered my laziness when coding; if you think I'm a skilled programmer, you're mistaken—I'm far from it.  Coding for over two hours often sends me into a spiral of existential questions, prompting me to question my path and consider alternative pursuits.  This README will henceforth serve as a sort of blog, or perhaps something else entirely.  I believe I'll improve someday.
